Subirachs' square located on the Passion façade of La Sagrada Família in Barcelona, Spain. Construction of the
cathedral started in 1882 with the original architect, Antoni Gaudí, finishing the designs; construction is ongoing.
Josep Maria Subirachs is the sculptor, and he created the square such that the magic sum was 33, or the year that many
believe was the age of Jesus Christ when he was executed. Digging deeper than just the sum, the repeated numbers (14,10)
sum to 48. INIR on the Roman alphabet also sum to 48 when their place on the alphabet is used. (I -> 9 N ->13 R -> 17 I ->9)
This was the inscription on Jesus' cross when he was executed, and is an initialism of Jesus of Nazareth, king of the Jews.
It's naming as a magic square is only half true, as in order to be a magic square you must use all numbers of n^2. This
implies no repeats and that all numbers must be there, from 1 to n^2. (This case would need 1-16.)
